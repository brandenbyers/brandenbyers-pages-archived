summary:    The beta release of Xcode 8 comes with a new theme named Civic. This is the same color theme used throughout WWDC 2016 marketing and with a simple tweak, it can also be used in Xcode 7.

If you want the new Xcode 8 beta theme for use in Xcode 7, navigate to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/` and copy/rename `Civic.xccolortheme` to `Civic.dvtcolortheme`.

I really like this new color theme and am going to use it as a replacement for my long time favorite Solarized Dark theme. I'm even going to try the new SF Mono font instead of Source Code Pro.

Now all I need is for Apple to release a dark mode for Xcode. I don't like having so much white UI in an otherwise dark editor. The best I can do for now is invert the colors in macOS (and use a light color theme).
